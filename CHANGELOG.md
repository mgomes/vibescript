# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Ongoing work toward the next pre-1.0 release.

## v0.28.1 - 2026-05-15

- Fixed module policy normalization so whitespace-only path segments cannot produce non-idempotent policy patterns or module names.
- Added the fuzz-minimized module policy case to the committed corpus so the regression is replayed by normal tests and future fuzz runs.

## v0.28.0 - 2026-05-15

- Added broad fuzz coverage across command input paths, formatting, lexing, parsing, compilation, runtime execution, JSON/value conversion, module handling, capability validation, and scalar input helpers.
- Added a `just fuzz` sweep with a 10-second default and a nightly GitHub Actions fuzz workflow for heavier automated coverage.
- Raised the LSP JSON-RPC payload cap so valid near-1 MiB source files are not rejected solely because of protocol framing overhead.
- Restored dot access for keyword-named hash/object members loaded from JSON or remapped data, such as `payload.raise` and `payload.begin`.

## v0.27.0 - 2026-05-04

- Hardened engine API snapshot boundaries so caller-mutated snapshots cannot corrupt later executions, including deep-cloned object-valued builtin tables.
- Tightened module containment by freezing configured module roots at engine creation, preventing cwd/symlink drift, and rejecting non-regular module files before reading.
- Aligned regex-based string helpers with the guarded `Regex` builtins for pattern, input, replacement, and output size limits.
- Added containment coverage for cyclic host arrays, mutable API snapshots, module root drift, regex guard bypasses, and related breakout paths while preserving benchmark smoke gates.
- Cleaned up Go API boundary and test hygiene with stronger error matching, interface checks, documentation, and focused performance follow-ups.

## v0.26.2 - 2026-03-08

- Fixed newline-sensitive parsing in control-flow headers and statement expressions so next-line literals no longer get consumed accidentally while explicit multiline continuations still work.
- Made `&&` and `||` short-circuit lazily and aligned integer division/modulo with Ruby-style floor semantics for signed integer algorithm ports.
- Added Ruby-friendly array query aliases and helpers with `length`, `empty?`, and `fetch`, plus stricter `array.fetch` index validation.
- Expanded regression coverage for Rosetta-style examples with multiline header parsing, short-circuit guards, signed integer arithmetic, and array helper behavior.

## v0.21.0 - 2026-03-08

- Added nominal enums with `::` member access, reflective member helpers, and typed symbol coercion across function and block boundaries.
- Hardened enum and type normalization with case-insensitive resolution, stricter enum-name validation, shadowed-scope lookup fixes, union/hash-key fast-path fixes, and recursive normalization guards.
- Added runnable enum examples and integration coverage, upgraded the REPL to Bubble Tea v2, and added a `just install` recipe for the CLI.
- Strengthened release and quality automation with a race-detector lane, fuzz and benchmark gate tuning, editor support docs, and idempotent release tag reruns.

## v0.20.0 - 2026-02-23

- Runtime call-path performance and benchmark-gating improvements ahead of 1.0.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-02-19

- Initial pre-1.0 project baseline and public documentation set.
