# Stdlib Method Reference

This page is the canonical reference for every built-in method and global
function the interpreter ships. Each entry is derived from the runtime member
dispatch tables, so the listing is complete: a method appears here if and only
if the interpreter implements it.

The narrative guides ([strings.md](strings.md), [arrays.md](arrays.md),
[hashes.md](hashes.md), [durations.md](durations.md), [time.md](time.md),
[builtins.md](builtins.md), [tasks.md](tasks.md)) explain idioms and patterns
in depth; this page favors compact signatures and one-line descriptions.

## How to Read Signatures

- `method(arg, optional = default, keyword: default) -> return_type` describes
  positional arguments, defaults, and keyword arguments.
- `{ |item| }` marks a method that takes a block, written
  `do |item| ... end` in Vibescript.
- `a | b` in a return type means the method returns either type.
- No method mutates its receiver. Every transform returns a new value,
  including Ruby-style bang methods. (Index and member assignment —
  `arr[0] = x`, `hash[:k] = v` — do mutate in place and are visible
  through aliases; only the method surface is copy-on-transform.)
- Bang variants (`strip!`, `gsub!`, ...) return the transformed value, or
  `nil` when nothing changed.

```vibe
"hello".strip!    # nil (nothing to strip)
"  hello ".strip! # "hello"
```

## Strings

See [strings.md](strings.md) for worked examples. Indexes and lengths count
Unicode characters, not bytes, unless noted.

### Inspection

- `size -> int` – number of characters.
- `length -> int` – alias for `size`.
- `bytesize -> int` – number of UTF-8 bytes.
- `empty? -> bool` – true when the string has no characters.
- `ord -> int` – codepoint of the first character; errors on an empty string.
- `chr -> string | nil` – first character, or `nil` for an empty string.

### Search and Matching

- `start_with?(*prefixes) -> bool` – true when the string begins with any of
  the given prefixes. Candidates are checked left to right and matching
  short-circuits, so a non-string is only rejected if reached before a match.
- `end_with?(*suffixes) -> bool` – true when the string ends with any of the
  given suffixes, with the same left-to-right short-circuit behavior.
- `include?(substring) -> bool` – true when `substring` occurs anywhere.
- `index(substring, offset = 0) -> int | nil` – first character index at or
  after `offset`; `nil` when not found.
- `rindex(substring, offset = size) -> int | nil` – last character index at or
  before `offset`; `nil` when not found.
- `match(pattern) -> array | nil` – regex match returning
  `[full, capture1, ...]` (unmatched groups are `nil`); `nil` when no match.
- `scan(pattern) -> array` – all non-overlapping full regex matches.

`match` and `scan` treat `pattern` as a regex and enforce the
[regex guard limits](#guard-limits).

```vibe
"2024-03-05".match("([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)") # ["2024-03", "2024", "03"]
```

### Slicing and Concatenation

- `slice(index) -> string | nil` – single character at `index`; `nil` when out
  of bounds.
- `slice(index, length) -> string | nil` – substring of up to `length`
  characters starting at `index`.
- `concat(*strings) -> string` – receiver with all arguments appended.
- `replace(replacement) -> string` – returns `replacement` (compatibility
  shim for Ruby's mutating `replace`).
- `clear -> string` – returns `""`.

### Case and Ordering Transforms

- `upcase -> string` – uppercase all characters (Unicode case mapping,
  locale-insensitive).
- `downcase -> string` – lowercase all characters.
- `capitalize -> string` – uppercase the first character, lowercase the rest.
- `swapcase -> string` – flip the case of each letter.
- `reverse -> string` – characters in reverse order.

### Whitespace and Affix Trimming

- `strip -> string` – trim leading and trailing whitespace.
- `lstrip -> string` – trim leading whitespace.
- `rstrip -> string` – trim trailing whitespace.
- `squish -> string` – trim both ends and collapse internal whitespace runs to
  a single space.
- `chomp(separator = nil) -> string` – remove one trailing `"\r\n"`, `"\n"`,
  or `"\r"`; with a `separator` remove that suffix once; with `""` remove all
  trailing newlines.
- `delete_prefix(prefix) -> string` – remove `prefix` when present.
- `delete_suffix(suffix) -> string` – remove `suffix` when present.

### Replacement, Splitting, and Templating

- `sub(pattern, replacement, regex: false) -> string` – replace the first
  occurrence of `pattern`.
- `gsub(pattern, replacement, regex: false) -> string` – replace every
  occurrence of `pattern`.
- `split(separator = nil) -> array` – split on whitespace (dropping empty
  fields) without arguments, or on `separator` when given.
- `chars -> array` – array of the string's Unicode characters, one per code
  point (rune-aware, like `length` and `slice`).
- `lines -> array` – array of lines split on `"\n"`, retaining the trailing
  newline on each line; an empty string yields no lines and carriage returns
  stay attached so `"\r\n"` endings round-trip.
- `template(context, strict: false) -> string` – interpolate `{{key.path}}`
  placeholders from a hash; `strict: true` errors on missing placeholders.

With `regex: true`, `sub`/`gsub` compile `pattern` as a regex, support `$1`
style group expansion in `replacement`, and enforce the
[regex guard limits](#guard-limits).

### Bang Variants

Each of the following returns the transformed string, or `nil` when the
transform changed nothing: `strip!`, `lstrip!`, `rstrip!`, `squish!`,
`chomp!`, `delete_prefix!`, `delete_suffix!`, `upcase!`, `downcase!`,
`capitalize!`, `swapcase!`, `reverse!`, `sub!`, `gsub!`.

## Arrays

See [arrays.md](arrays.md) for worked examples. Arrays also support `+`
(concatenation) and `-` (value subtraction) operators.

### Inspection

- `size -> int` – element count.
- `length -> int` – alias for `size`.
- `empty? -> bool` – true when the array has no elements.

### Iteration

- `each { |item| } -> array` – yield each element; returns the receiver.
- `each_slice(n) { |slice| } -> nil` – yield non-overlapping slices of length
  `n` (the trailing slice may be shorter); `n` must be a positive integer.
- `each_cons(n) { |window| } -> nil` – yield each sliding window of length `n`;
  arrays shorter than `n` yield nothing and `n` must be a positive integer.
- `reverse_each { |item| } -> array` – yield elements from last to first;
  returns the receiver.
- `cycle(n = nil) { |item| } -> nil` – yield the whole array `n` times; a
  non-positive `n` yields nothing. Omitting `n` or passing `nil` cycles forever,
  bounded by the step quota and context cancellation.
- `map { |item| } -> array` – new array of block results.
- `select { |item| } -> array` – elements for which the block is truthy.
- `reject { |item| } -> array` – elements for which the block is falsy (the
  inverse of `select`).
- `take_while { |item| } -> array` – leading elements until the block first
  returns a falsy value; stops at the first miss.
- `drop_while { |item| } -> array` – elements remaining after skipping the
  leading run for which the block is truthy.
- `grep(pattern) { |item| } -> array` – elements that match `pattern` using the
  case-equality direction (`pattern === item`); a `Range` matches by membership
  and other values by equality. The optional block transforms each match.
- `grep_v(pattern) { |item| } -> array` – elements that do not match `pattern`,
  with the same matching rules and optional transform block as `grep`.
- `find { |item| } -> value | nil` – first element matching the block.
- `find_index { |item| } -> int | nil` – index of the first match.
- `reduce(initial = nil) { |acc, item| } -> value` – fold left; without
  `initial` the first element seeds the accumulator (errors on an empty
  array).

### Membership and Counting

- `include?(value) -> bool` – membership test using value equality.
- `index(value, offset = 0) -> int | nil` – first index of `value` at or
  after `offset`.
- `rindex(value, offset = last_index) -> int | nil` – last index of `value`
  at or before `offset`.
- `fetch(index, default = nil) -> value` – element at `index`, or
  `default`/`nil` when out of bounds.
- `count -> int` – element count.
- `count(value) -> int` – occurrences of `value`.
- `count { |item| } -> int` – elements for which the block is truthy.
- `any? { |item| } -> bool` – true when any element (or block result) is
  truthy.
- `all? { |item| } -> bool` – true when every element (or block result) is
  truthy.
- `none? { |item| } -> bool` – true when no element (or block result) is
  truthy.

### Building and Slicing

- `push(*values) -> array` – new array with `values` appended.
- `pop(n = nil) -> hash` – returns `{ array:, popped: }`; bare `pop` pops one
  element (`popped` is the value or `nil`), `pop(n)` pops up to `n` elements
  (`popped` is an array).
- `first -> value | nil` / `first(n) -> array` – leading element(s).
- `last -> value | nil` / `last(n) -> array` – trailing element(s).
- `uniq -> array` – distinct values, keeping first occurrences.
- `compact -> array` – elements with `nil` entries removed.
- `flatten(depth = nil) -> array` – collapse nested arrays; flattens fully
  without a depth.
- `chunk(size) -> array` – consecutive slices of `size` elements (last chunk
  may be shorter).
- `window(size) -> array` – overlapping windows of `size` elements; empty when
  `size` exceeds the array length.
- `join(separator = "") -> string` – stringified elements joined by
  `separator`.
- `reverse -> array` – elements in reverse order.

Because array methods never mutate the receiver, `pop` hands back both
halves of the result:

```vibe
items = [1, 2, 3]
items.pop    # {array: [1, 2], popped: 3}
items.pop(2) # {array: [1], popped: [2, 3]}
```

### Aggregation, Ordering, and Grouping

- `sum -> int | float` – total of numeric elements (`0` for an empty array).
- `sort -> array` – stable sort using natural ordering.
- `sort { |a, b| } -> array` – stable sort using a comparator block returning
  a negative, zero, or positive number.
- `sort_by { |item| } -> array` – stable sort by the block's key for each
  element.
- `partition { |item| } -> array` – `[matching, non_matching]` pair of arrays.
- `group_by { |item| } -> hash` – group elements by block result (must be a
  symbol or string).
- `group_by_stable { |item| } -> array` – `[key, items]` pairs preserving
  first-seen group order.
- `tally -> hash` / `tally { |item| } -> hash` – occurrence counts keyed by
  element (or block result); keys must be symbols or strings.
- `min -> value | nil` / `max -> value | nil` – smallest/largest element using
  natural ordering; `nil` for an empty array.
- `minmax -> array` – `[min, max]` in one pass; `[nil, nil]` for an empty array.
- `min_by { |item| } -> value | nil` / `max_by { |item| } -> value | nil` –
  element with the smallest/largest block key; `nil` for an empty array. Ties
  resolve to the first matching element.

String and symbol ordering uses deterministic codepoint comparison (no locale
collation).

```vibe
[5, 1, 4].sort do |a, b|
  b - a
end
# [5, 4, 1]
```

## Hashes

See [hashes.md](hashes.md) for worked examples. Hash keys use one string lookup
space; shorthand symbol labels and quoted string keys normalize to the same
entries. `keys`, `values`, and all block-based iteration visit entries in
sorted key order for determinism.

Property access (`record.name`) resolves the hash methods below before stored
keys, so method names stay stable even when data contains the same key:

```vibe
sizes = { size: "XL" }
sizes.size            # 1
sizes[:size]          # "XL"
{ color: "red" }.size # 1
```

Use index access (`hash[:size]`) to read entries whose names collide with hash
methods.

### Inspection

- `size -> int` – entry count.
- `length -> int` – alias for `size`.
- `empty? -> bool` – true when the hash has no entries.
- `key?(key) -> bool` – true when `key` is present.
- `has_key?(key) -> bool` – alias for `key?`.
- `member?(key) -> bool` – alias for `key?`.
- `include?(key) -> bool` – alias for `key?`.
- `value?(value) -> bool` – true when any stored value equals `value` using `==`.
- `has_value?(value) -> bool` – alias for `value?`.

### Access

- `fetch(key, default = nil) -> value` – value for `key`, or `default`/`nil`
  when missing.
- `fetch_values(*keys) { |key| } -> array` – values for `keys` in requested
  order. Raises `key not found` for any missing key; when a block is given it is
  called with each missing key and its result is used instead.
- `dig(*keys) -> value | nil` – nested lookup following `keys`; `nil` when any
  step is missing.
- `keys -> array` – symbol keys in sorted order.
- `values -> array` – values in sorted key order.

### Iteration

- `each { |key, value| } -> hash` – yield each pair; returns the receiver.
- `each_key { |key| } -> hash` – yield each key.
- `each_value { |value| } -> hash` – yield each value.

### Transform and Filter

- `merge(other) -> hash` – combined entries; `other` wins on key conflicts.
- `merge(other) { |key, old_value, new_value| } -> hash` – combined entries; for
  keys present in both hashes the block resolves the conflict and its result is
  stored. Keys present on only one side are copied without invoking the block,
  and the conflict key is yielded as a symbol.
- `store(key, value) -> hash` – new hash with `key` assigned to `value`; the
  receiver is left unchanged (immutable-style, unlike Ruby's mutating `store`).
- `slice(*keys) -> hash` – only the listed keys (missing keys are skipped).
- `except(*keys) -> hash` – all entries except the listed keys. Unsupported key
  types (anything other than a symbol or string) are ignored as Ruby misses, so
  the entry is kept rather than raising.
- `select { |key, value| } -> hash` – entries for which the block is truthy.
- `reject { |key, value| } -> hash` – entries for which the block is falsy.
- `compact -> hash` – entries with `nil` values removed.
- `transform_keys { |key| } -> hash` – rename keys via the block (must return
  a symbol or string).
- `deep_transform_keys { |key| } -> hash` – `transform_keys` applied
  recursively through nested hashes and arrays; rejects cyclic structures.
- `remap_keys(mapping) -> hash` – rename keys using a `{ old: :new }` hash;
  unmapped keys pass through.
- `transform_values { |value| } -> hash` – replace each value with the block
  result.

## Integers

### Duration Constructors

Each returns a `duration` spanning that many units. Singular forms are
aliases, so `1.second` reads naturally.

- `seconds` / `second` -> duration
- `minutes` / `minute` -> duration
- `hours` / `hour` -> duration
- `days` / `day` -> duration
- `weeks` / `week` -> duration

### Numeric Helpers

- `abs -> int` – absolute value; errors on the minimum 64-bit integer.
- `clamp(min, max) -> int` – receiver bounded to `[min, max]`; both bounds
  must be integers with `min <= max`.
- `even? -> bool` – true for even integers.
- `odd? -> bool` – true for odd integers.
- `times { |i| } -> int` – run the block with `0..n-1`; returns the receiver.
- `zero? -> bool` – true when the integer is `0`.
- `positive? -> bool` – true when greater than `0`.
- `negative? -> bool` – true when less than `0`.
- `nonzero? -> int?` – the receiver when nonzero, otherwise `nil`, matching
  Ruby (the result is truthy exactly when the number is nonzero).
- `next -> int` / `succ -> int` – the next integer (`self + 1`); errors on
  64-bit overflow rather than wrapping.
- `pred -> int` – the previous integer (`self - 1`); errors on 64-bit
  underflow rather than wrapping.
- `round(ndigits = 0) -> int` – non-negative `ndigits` return the receiver
  unchanged; negative `ndigits` round to the matching power of ten (e.g.
  `1234.round(-2)` is `1200`) half away from zero.
- `floor(ndigits = 0) -> int` – like `round`, but negative `ndigits` truncate
  toward negative infinity (`1234.floor(-2)` is `1200`, `(-1234).floor(-2)` is
  `-1300`).
- `ceil(ndigits = 0) -> int` – like `round`, but negative `ndigits` round
  toward positive infinity (`1234.ceil(-2)` is `1300`).
- `div(n) -> int` – floored division; the quotient rounds toward negative
  infinity, so mixed-sign operands round down (`(-5).div(2)` is `-3`). A zero
  divisor errors, and the one quotient outside the 64-bit range
  (`min_int.div(-1)`) errors rather than wrapping.
- `divmod(n) -> [quotient, modulo]` – the floored quotient and the modulo whose
  sign follows the divisor. With integer arguments both elements are integers;
  a float argument makes the modulo a float.
- `fdiv(n) -> float` – floating division. Unlike Ruby, a zero divisor errors
  rather than yielding infinity, matching the `/` operator.
- `remainder(n) -> int|float` – remainder whose sign follows the receiver
  (truncated division), which differs from `%` for operands of opposite sign;
  a zero divisor errors.
- `modulo(n) -> int|float` – the `%` operator as a method: the result's sign
  follows the divisor (floored division). Integer operands yield an integer;
  any float operand yields a float; a zero divisor errors.

`round`, `floor`, and `ceil` accept an optional Integer precision. As in Ruby,
the precision must fit a 32-bit signed integer (Ruby reads it through `NUM2INT`),
so a magnitude beyond that range raises rather than acting as a no-op. Results
that leave the 64-bit integer range raise an error rather than widening like
Ruby's arbitrary-precision integers.

## Floats

- `abs -> float` – absolute value.
- `clamp(min, max) -> float` – receiver bounded to `[min, max]`; bounds may be
  int or float with `min <= max`.
- `round(ndigits = 0) -> int | float` – round half away from zero. With no
  argument or `0` it returns an `int`; positive `ndigits` keep the value a
  `float` rounded to that many fractional digits (`1.234.round(2)` is `1.23`);
  negative `ndigits` return an `int` bucketed to a power of ten.
- `floor(ndigits = 0) -> int | float` – round toward negative infinity, with
  the same `int`/`float` return rules as `round`.
- `ceil(ndigits = 0) -> int | float` – round toward positive infinity, with the
  same `int`/`float` return rules as `round`.
- `zero? -> bool` – true when the value is `0.0`.
- `positive? -> bool` – true when greater than `0.0`.
- `negative? -> bool` – true when less than `0.0`.
- `nonzero? -> float?` – the receiver when nonzero, otherwise `nil`, matching
  Ruby (the result is truthy exactly when the number is nonzero).
- `div(n) -> int` – floored division returning an integer; a zero divisor
  errors, as does a quotient outside the 64-bit range.
- `divmod(n) -> [int, float]` – the floored quotient (an integer) and the
  float modulo whose sign follows the divisor.
- `fdiv(n) -> float` – floating division; a zero divisor errors rather than
  yielding infinity, matching the `/` operator.
- `remainder(n) -> float` – remainder whose sign follows the receiver
  (truncated division); a zero divisor errors.
- `modulo(n) -> float` – the `%` operator as a method: the result's sign
  follows the divisor (floored division); a zero divisor errors.

`round`, `floor`, and `ceil` accept an optional Integer precision that defaults
to `0`. As in Ruby, the precision must fit a 32-bit signed integer, so a
magnitude beyond that range raises rather than acting as a no-op. Whenever the
result is converted back to an `int` (zero or negative precision), values outside
the 64-bit integer range raise an error.

Vibescript has no rational number type, so Ruby's `quo` (which returns a
`Rational` for integer operands) is intentionally not provided; use `fdiv` for
floating division.

## Money

Money values are created with the `money` and `money_cents` builtins and
support arithmetic and comparison operators.

- `currency -> string` – ISO currency code, e.g. `"USD"`.
- `cents -> int` – total amount in minor units.
- `amount -> string` – formatted amount with currency, e.g. `"100.50 USD"`.
- `format -> string` – same as `amount`.

```vibe
m = money("100.50 USD")
m.cents    # 10050
m.currency # "USD"
m.amount   # "100.50 USD"
```

## Durations

See [durations.md](durations.md) for arithmetic and worked examples.

### Whole-Unit Conversions

Each returns an `int` truncated toward zero. Singular forms are aliases.

- `seconds` / `second` -> int – total seconds.
- `minutes` / `minute` -> int – total whole minutes.
- `hours` / `hour` -> int – total whole hours.
- `days` / `day` -> int – total whole days.
- `weeks` / `week` -> int – total whole weeks.

### Fractional Conversions

Each returns a `float`. Months use 30-day and years 365-day approximations.

- `in_seconds -> float`
- `in_minutes -> float`
- `in_hours -> float`
- `in_days -> float`
- `in_weeks -> float`
- `in_months -> float` – approximate (30-day months).
- `in_years -> float` – approximate (365-day years).

```vibe
90.seconds.minutes    # 1 (truncated)
90.seconds.in_minutes # 1.5
```

### Formatting and Conversion

- `iso8601 -> string` – ISO 8601 duration, e.g. `"PT1H30M"`.
- `parts -> hash` – `{ days:, hours:, minutes:, seconds: }` breakdown.
- `to_i -> int` – total seconds.
- `to_s -> string` – seconds string, e.g. `"5400s"`.
- `format -> string` – same as `to_s`.
- `eql?(other) -> bool` – true when both durations span the same seconds.

```vibe
shift = 90.minutes
shift.parts   # {days: 0, hours: 1, minutes: 30, seconds: 0}
shift.iso8601 # "PT1H30M"
```

### Anchoring to Times

Each accepts an optional `Time` (or RFC3339 string) and defaults to the
current time; the result is a UTC `Time`.

- `after(start = Time.now) -> time` – `start` plus the duration.
- `since(start = Time.now) -> time` – alias for `after`.
- `from_now(start = Time.now) -> time` – alias for `after`.
- `ago(start = Time.now) -> time` – `start` minus the duration.
- `before(start = Time.now) -> time` – alias for `ago`.
- `until(start = Time.now) -> time` – alias for `ago`.

```vibe
5.minutes.ago(Time.utc(2024, 1, 1)).iso8601 # "2023-12-31T23:55:00Z"
```

## Times

See [time.md](time.md) for construction, zone handling, and layout-based
formatting. Times also support `time + duration`, `time - duration`, and
`time - time -> duration` arithmetic.

### Components

- `year -> int` – calendar year.
- `month` / `mon` -> int – month of year (1-12).
- `day` / `mday` -> int – day of month.
- `hour -> int` – hour of day (0-23).
- `min -> int` – minute of hour.
- `sec -> int` – second of minute.
- `usec` / `tv_usec` -> int – microsecond component.
- `nsec` / `tv_nsec` -> int – nanosecond component.
- `subsec -> float` – fractional second as a float.
- `wday -> int` – day of week (0 = Sunday).
- `yday -> int` – day of year (1-366).

### Zone and Offset

- `zone -> string` – zone abbreviation, e.g. `"UTC"`.
- `utc_offset` / `gmt_offset` / `gmtoff` -> int – offset from UTC in seconds.

### Predicates

- `utc?` / `gmt?` -> bool – true for UTC times.
- `dst?` / `isdst` -> bool – true when daylight saving time is in effect.
- `sunday?`, `monday?`, `tuesday?`, `wednesday?`, `thursday?`, `friday?`,
  `saturday?` -> bool – day-of-week checks.

### Conversions

- `to_i` / `tv_sec` -> int – seconds since the Unix epoch.
- `to_f -> float` – epoch seconds with fractional part.
- `to_r -> float` – same as `to_f` (rationals are not supported).
- `to_s -> string` – RFC3339Nano representation.
- `to_a -> array` – positional tuple `[sec, min, hour, mday, month, year, wday,
  yday, isdst, zone]`, matching Ruby's field order and the receiver's zone.
- `iso8601(ndigits = 0)` / `rfc3339(ndigits = 0)` -> string – RFC3339 representation. With no argument it emits whole seconds; a non-negative `ndigits` appends that many fractional-second digits, truncated toward zero (matching Ruby's `Time#iso8601`). Negative, non-integer, or out-of-range (above 100 digits) precision raises a runtime error.
- `hash -> int` – nanoseconds since the Unix epoch (identity value).

### Zone Conversion

- `utc` / `gmtime` -> time – the same instant in UTC.
- `getutc` / `getgm` -> time – aliases for `utc`.
- `localtime(offset = nil) -> time` – the same instant in the supplied zone,
  or the host's local zone when the argument is omitted or `nil`. The offset
  follows the usual zone rules: a fixed offset such as `"+05:30"` or `"-04:00"`,
  a named zone such as `"America/New_York"`, or `"UTC"`. Returns a new `Time`;
  the receiver is never mutated.
- `getlocal(offset = nil) -> time` – alias for `localtime`.

### Formatting

- `format(layout) -> string` – format with a Go layout string (reference time
  `Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006`).
- `strftime` – not supported; raises an error directing you to `format`.

### Comparison and Rounding

- `<=>(other) -> int` – `-1`, `0`, or `1` ordering against another time.
- `eql?(other) -> bool` – true when both times are the same instant.
- `round(ndigits = 0) -> time` – round to the given number of fractional-second
  digits, half away from zero. No argument or `0` rounds to whole seconds;
  positive `ndigits` rounds to that many digits (e.g. `3` for milliseconds, `6`
  for microseconds), capped at nanosecond resolution. `ndigits` must be a
  non-negative `Integer`; other values raise an error.
- `floor -> time` – truncate to the whole second.
- `ceil -> time` – round up to the next whole second.

## Enum Values

Enum members obtained via `EnumName::member` expose three properties (see
[enums.md](enums.md)):

- `name -> string` – member name, e.g. `"active"`.
- `symbol -> symbol` – member symbol, e.g. `:active`.
- `enum -> enum` – the defining enum.

## Ranges

Ranges (`1..5`, `1...5`) have no methods; they are consumed by `for ... in`
loops. `case`/`when` uses range candidates as numeric membership tests. See
[control-flow.md](control-flow.md).

## Builtin Functions

Global functions and namespaces available in every script. See
[builtins.md](builtins.md) for narrative examples.

### Global Functions

- `assert(condition, message = nil, message: nil) -> nil` – raise an assertion
  failure when `condition` is falsy; the message comes from the second
  positional argument or the `message:` keyword.
- `money(literal) -> money` – parse a `"amount CURRENCY"` string, e.g.
  `money("25.00 USD")`.
- `money_cents(cents, currency) -> money` – build money from integer minor
  units, e.g. `money_cents(2550, "USD")`.
- `now -> string` – current UTC instant as an RFC3339 string (use `Time.now`
  for a `time` value).
- `uuid -> string` – RFC 9562 version 7 UUID.
- `random_id(length = 16) -> string` – unbiased alphanumeric token; `length`
  must be between 1 and 1024.
- `to_int(value) -> int` – convert an int, integral float, or base-10 numeric
  string; errors otherwise.
- `to_float(value) -> float` – convert an int, float, or finite numeric
  string; errors otherwise.
- `require(module_name, as: nil) -> object` – load a module and return its
  exports; `as:` binds the module object to a name. See
  [builtins.md](builtins.md#module-loading).

`now` and `uuid` auto-invoke, so they can be called without parentheses.

### JSON

- `JSON.parse(string) -> value` – parse JSON into hashes, arrays, strings,
  ints, floats, bools, and nils; rejects trailing data.
- `JSON.stringify(value) -> string` – serialize hashes/objects, arrays, and
  scalars; symbols and enum values become strings; rejects cyclic structures.

Both directions enforce a 1 MiB payload limit and reject more than 10,000
nested arrays/objects.

### Regex

Note the argument order: `match` takes the pattern first, while the replace
helpers take the text first.

Regex patterns are quoted strings. Ruby-style `/pattern/` regex literals are
not supported.

- `Regex.match(pattern, text) -> string | nil` – first match, or `nil`.
- `Regex.replace(text, pattern, replacement) -> string` – replace the first
  match; `replacement` supports `$1` style group expansion.
- `Regex.replace_all(text, pattern, replacement) -> string` – replace every
  match.

```vibe
Regex.match("ID-[0-9]+", "ID-12 ID-34")       # "ID-12"
Regex.replace("ID-12", "ID-([0-9]+)", "X-$1") # "X-12"
```

Patterns use Go's RE2 syntax and enforce the
[regex guard limits](#guard-limits).

### Duration

- `Duration.build(seconds) -> duration` – build from total seconds.
- `Duration.build(weeks:, days:, hours:, minutes:, seconds:) -> duration` –
  build from named parts; at least one part is required (a bare
  `Duration.build()` errors), and positional seconds and named parts are
  mutually exclusive.
- `Duration.parse(string) -> duration` – parse Go duration strings (`"1h30m"`,
  whole seconds only) or ISO 8601 durations (`"PT90S"`, `"P2W"`).

```vibe
Duration.parse("1h30m").seconds # 5400
Duration.parse("P2W").days      # 14
```

### Time

Zone keywords accept IANA names (`"America/New_York"`), `"UTC"`/`"GMT"`,
`"LOCAL"`, or numeric offsets like `"+05:30"`.

- `Time.new(year, month, day, hour = 0, min = 0, sec = 0, zone = nil,
  in: nil) -> time` – build from calendar parts (local zone by default).
- `Time.local(...)` / `Time.mktime(...)` -> time – like `Time.new` with the
  local zone as the default; an explicit zone argument still overrides it.
- `Time.utc(...)` / `Time.gm(...)` -> time – like `Time.new` with UTC as the
  default; an explicit zone argument still overrides it
  (`Time.utc(2024, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, "+05:30")` is `+05:30`, not UTC).
- `Time.at(epoch_seconds, in: nil) -> time` – build from Unix epoch seconds
  (int or float).
- `Time.now(in: nil) -> time` – current time (local zone by default).
- `Time.parse(string, layout = nil, in: nil) -> time` – parse a time string;
  without a layout it tries RFC3339/RFC3339Nano, RFC1123/RFC1123Z,
  `YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM:SS]`, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, `YYYY/MM/DD[ HH:MM:SS]`,
  and `MM/DD/YYYY[ HH:MM:SS]`.

### Tasks

Structured concurrency entry points; see [tasks.md](tasks.md) for the task
manager API, retention rules, and concurrency settings.

- `Tasks.run(max: nil) { |tasks| } -> value` – run a block with a task
  manager for spawning concurrent work; returns the block's value.
- `Tasks.map(items, with: function_name, max: nil) -> array` – apply a named
  function to each element concurrently, preserving order.

The manager passed to the `Tasks.run` block exposes two methods, and
`spawn` returns a task handle with one; all of them raise once the task
scope has exited:

- `tasks.spawn(function_name, args..., keyword: ...) -> task` – start the
  named function concurrently with the given arguments; returns a handle.
- `tasks.wait -> nil` – block until every spawned task has finished.
- `task.value -> value` – wait for this task and return its result,
  raising the task's error if it failed.

## Guard Limits

JSON, regex, and ID helpers enforce fixed input-guard limits so hostile
data cannot exhaust host memory or CPU. The limits are not configurable
and apply to the `JSON`/`Regex` builtins and the regex-enabled string
members (`match`, `scan`, `sub`, `gsub`, and their `!` variants):

| Guard | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| `JSON.parse` input / `JSON.stringify` output | 1 MiB |
| `JSON.parse` / `JSON.stringify` nesting depth | 10,000 arrays/objects |
| Regex pattern size (`Regex.*`, `match`, `scan`, `sub`/`gsub` with `regex: true`) | 16 KiB |
| Regex text, replacement, and output size | 1 MiB |
| `random_id` length | 1024 characters |

Exceeding a limit raises a runtime error naming the offending guard.
The canonical values live in the documented const block in
`internal/runtime/limits.go`; the README's "Runtime Sandbox & Limits"
section summarizes them alongside the configurable engine quotas.

For a runnable end-to-end sample, see `examples/stdlib/core_utilities.vibe`.
